    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A shared rulebook or constitution document being read by both a human figure and an AI agent icon, with a CI/CD pipeline gate in the background enforcing these standards. Shows consistency, shared understanding, and automated enforcement. Documents labeled with tech stack, style guides, testing rules. Style: collaborative with automated governance overlay. -->
    
    ## Rules for Humans & AI

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Tech stack</li>
      <li class="fragment">Coding style</li>
      <li class="fragment">Testing approach</li>
      <li class="fragment">Run &amp; test commands</li>
      <li class="fragment">CI/CD enforcement</li>
    </ul>
    
    Note:
    AI‑readable standards (talk section "Enforceable Project Standards"):
      - Purpose: living contract for humans + preloadable context for AI.
      - Contents: tech stack constraints; formatting & style conventions; testing philosophy (types of tests + coverage priorities); canonical run/build/test commands; security / error handling patterns.
      - Workflow: generate initial drafts *from* existing codebase → refine → store as discrete files (e.g., /docs/AI_GUIDELINES.md, /docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md).
      - Usage: inject into first prompt before any generation ("house rules").
      - Benefits: faster onboarding, reduced style drift, higher first‑try accuracy from models.
      - CI/CD Enforcement: integrate guidelines into CI to actively block divergence; prevents drift, speeds onboarding, aligns human + AI contributors through automated standards checking.
    
    Transition: With these guardrails in place, the human role fundamentally shifts to Strategic Engineer.
