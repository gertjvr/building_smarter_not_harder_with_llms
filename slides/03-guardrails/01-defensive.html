    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A shield or protective barrier around code symbols, with multiple layers of defense (static analysis scanner, verification checkmarks, test coverage meters). Shows protection without slowing down. Style: security-focused but enabling, not restrictive. -->
    
    ## Hyper-Defensive Coding

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Static analysis</li>
      <li class="fragment">Formal verification</li>
      <li class="fragment">Extensive coverage</li>
    </ul>
 
    Note:
    Guardrails motivation (talk: “potential for quality to nosedive if left unchecked”):
      - Hyper‑defensive posture compensates for volume & speed of AI output.
      - Static analysis: immediate structural & type issues before runtime.
      - Formal verification (selective): critical paths / invariants (e.g., financial calc, auth flows) → mathematical assurance.
      - Extensive coverage: behavior net; focus on *meaningful* scenarios & edge boundaries, not trivial loops.
    
    Principle: assume AI will occasionally introduce subtle regressions; design systems to surface them fast.
    
    Transition: translate principles into daily habits.
