    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A series of healthy workflow habits illustrated as icons: git commits as checkpoints/save points, pruning shears removing dead tests, documentation growing like organized files, planning as a GPS/roadmap. Style: clean icons suggesting good practices and discipline. -->
    
    ## Practical Habits

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Frequent commits (rollback points)</li>
      <li class="fragment">Prune pointless tests</li>
      <li class="fragment">Comprehensive documentation</li>
      <li class="fragment">Control through planning</li>
    </ul>
    
    Note:
    Practical habits (talk highlights):
      - Frequent commits: treat as checkpoints; rapid rollback when an agent “goes sideways”.
      - Prune pointless tests: AI loves to over‑generate trivial assertions; keep suite fast & signal‑rich.
      - Comprehensive documentation: generate implementation guides; feed back as context for subsequent agent passes (compounding clarity).
      - Control via planning: blueprint = change budget + alignment artifact; prevents getting “over your skis”.
      - Add: Use CI to auto‑enforce lint, type, test, security scans—bots gate bots.
    
    Segue: Beyond habits, encode standards so AI *starts* aligned.
