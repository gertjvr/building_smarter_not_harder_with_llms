    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A sleek spiral or circular diagram showing 3 phases: "Idea Honing" (lightbulb + question marks), "Blueprint" (architectural plan/grid), "Execute" (gear/code symbols). Center shows "15 min" timer. Arrows suggest rapid iteration. Style: modern infographic, energetic but controlled. -->

    ## Rapid Planning Loop

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Idea Honing → Specification</li>
      <li class="fragment">Blueprint → Chunked Prompt Plan</li>
      <li class="fragment">Execute → Review (tests / refine)</li>
    </ul>

    <span class="fragment">Full planning often in a few minutes.</span>

    Note:
    - Idea Honing → Specification: one‑question‑at‑a‑time interrogation yields developer‑ready spec (requirements, architecture, data, errors, testing).
    - Blueprint → Prompt Plan: reasoning model (not code yet) breaks spec into safe, incremental, integrated steps; produces prompts + checklist.
    - Execute → Review: code‑gen model implements each prompt sequentially; automated tests + static analysis + human spot checks close the loop.
  
    Micro waterfall: distinct Plan / Build / Review phases but rapid, repeatable cycles.
  
    Concurrency hook: multiple agents can run off the same blueprint (feature, docs, tests) without losing coherence.

    Emphasize speed: in a few minutes to go from raw idea to actionable blueprint enables live planning in meetings / pairing.

    Transition: Next we deep dive Idea Honing mechanics, then show prompts that drive specification & blueprint.
