    Note: 
    Bridge from agenda to collaboration mindset (Harper Reed inspiration).
    
    Fundamental shift in developer role:
    - Old model: deep "flow state" coding, disappearing into the editor for hours.
    - New model: strategic orchestration â€” directing multiple AI agents, maintaining quality, focusing on product outcomes.

    Reinforce contrast: not about simply generating code blobs; definitely not about "vibe coding" where AI freestyles without structure.
    
    It's about deliberate, structured, strategic building with AI as active partner.
    
    Transition: Let's define what this partnership actually looks like in practice.
