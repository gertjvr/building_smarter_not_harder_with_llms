    Note: 
    This is not just about tools — it’s about a change in how we think about building software.
    Old model: deep “flow state” coding, disappearing into the editor.
    New model: strategic orchestration — directing multiple moving parts.

    This isn’t about simply generating code; it’s not about vibe coding.
    It’s about deliberate, structured, strategic building.
