    Note:
      Purpose: give audience mental roadmap of shift → workflow → safety → role → validation → interaction.
      
      - Inspiration & shift: credit Harper Reed; framing of rapid planning upfront replacing ad‑hoc hacking.
      - AI as collaborator: reject "vibe coding"; partnership & orchestration language.
      - Planning trio: Idea Honing (Q&A) → Spec (developer‑ready) → Blueprint (chunked prompt plan).
      - Micro waterfall & parallel agents: plan → build → review loops; concurrent feature/docs/tests agents = throughput.
      - Guardrails: hyper‑defensive habits (static analysis, selective formal verification, meaningful coverage, frequent commits, pruning noise) + AI‑readable standards (house rules loaded first).
      - Strategic Engineer: human moves to shaping prompts, tests, architecture, product alignment—enabled by guardrails.
      - Real-world examples: validation of the complete framework through concrete implementations.
      - Discussion / Q&A: invite workflows, bottlenecks, success/failure stories.
      
      Anchor line: “Fast code is useless without control.”
      
      Transition: Dive into Idea Honing to show first collaborative planning phase.
