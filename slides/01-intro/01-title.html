    ![Building smarter, not harder with LLMs](./assets/images/slide-01.png)

    Note:
    - Good afternoon everyone. (Pause, smile, eye contact.) Acknowledge it's late in the day / second last talk. Light chuckle line. 
    - Mention I went to the vibe coding session – this talk is *not* that; it's about building smarter, not harder, and not letting AI freestyle the codebase into oblivion. 
    - Set expectation: we’ll focus on collaboration, planning, guardrails. Transition: credit Harper Reed’s recent posts for framing the shift.

    [ASK] “Quick show of hands — who’s used AI to write any code in the last month?”  
    [PAUSE for audience reaction; respond to the proportion in the room]
