    ![Building smarter, not harder with LLMs](img/slide-01.png)

    Note:
    Opening (deliver deliberately):
      - “Good afternoon everyone.” (Pause, smile, make eye contact with different sections.)
      - “I know it’s been a long day — second last talk before we head off.” (Light chuckle / empathy moment.)
      - “Yes, I did attend the vibe coding session this morning… and this talk is definitely *not* that.”
      - Contrast: Not about letting AI freestyle the codebase into oblivion; about building smarter, not harder.
      - Credit Harper Reed’s recent blog posts for inspiring the framing: shift from hand‑crafting every line toward orchestration + guardrails.
    
    Frame the through‑line: AI as collaborator → rapid planning loops → micro waterfall cycles → strategic engineer role → hyper‑defensive guardrails → enforceable standards.
    
    Engagement:
      - Ask: “Quick show of hands — who’s used AI to write *any* code in the last month?” 
      - React proportionally (if most: “Great, we’ll sharpen that workflow”; if few: “Perfect—this will accelerate your on‑ramp.”)

    Transition to agenda.
