    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: Two figures (human and AI) in a circular dance/partnership, with arrows showing iterative flow between them. Human figure emanating "intent/constraints" while AI figure shows "code/integration". Background suggests velocity/movement but controlled. Style: modern, clean diagram. -->

    ## AI as Collaborator

    - Not just code gen <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Not "vibe coding" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Structured partnership <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Iterative loop: Idea → Spec → Blueprint → Execute <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - You: intent/tests • AI: accelerate/integrate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

    Note:
    Core message: AI shifts from tool to *active collaborator*; we orchestrate.
    
    Contrast first: not just firing prompts for blobs of code, not laissez‑faire "vibe coding".
    
    Define partnership cycle: you shape intent & constraints → AI proposes / implements → automated checks + you review → refine → next micro loop.
    
    Tie to loop: Idea Honing (Q&A) → Spec → Blueprint (prompt plan) → Execute (sequential code generation) → Review.
    
    Roles: Human = product sense, risk spotting, test design, architectural coherence. AI = rapid boilerplate + iterative change + parallel tasks (feature, docs, tests).
    
    Emphasize control: speed without drifting because planning & guardrails bound each loop.
    
    Transition: We'll zoom into Idea Honing next.
