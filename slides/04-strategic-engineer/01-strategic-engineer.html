  <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A conductor orchestrating multiple AI agents/workers, each handling different tasks (coding, testing, documenting). Conductor figure elevated, holding strategic tools (prompts, quality metrics, architecture plans). Background shows velocity but controlled chaos. Style: leadership/orchestration metaphor, dignified but dynamic. -->
  
  ## Strategic Engineer

  ### From Code Craft → AI Orchestration

  Note:
  Role evolution (full talk: shift from “code as craft” / deep flow to orchestration):
    - Strategic Engineer is product manager + architect + quality assurance tester + developer more than just a prompt engineer.
    - Shaping prompts: distill intent & constraints; short precise prompts can outperform verbose walls.
    - Defining tests: codify expectations so AI can self‑verify (bots test their own output).
    - Maintaining quality: enforce structure, readability, performance, security hygiene while velocity spikes.
    - Handling edge cases: anticipate failure modes / data anomalies LLM may overlook.
  
    Mindset change: embrace context switching (AI working = your thinking window). Flow ≠ hours of typing; flow = steering multiple autonomous efforts.
  
  Audience prod: "Who still hand‑writes routine CRUD? What higher‑leverage activity could replace that time?"
  
  Transition: Now let's see this complete framework—process + guardrails + strategic role—in action through real examples
