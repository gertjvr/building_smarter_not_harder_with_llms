    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A compact waterfall diagram with 3 tight phases (Plan, Build, Review) in a rapid loop. Multiple parallel streams showing concurrent agents (features, docs, tests). Emphasis on speed and iteration, not traditional lengthy waterfall. Style: dynamic flow diagram, modern and agile. -->
    
    ## Micro Waterfall

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Plan → Build → Review (loop)</li>
      <li class="fragment">Parallel agents: features, docs, tests</li>
    </ul>
    
    Note:
    Micro Waterfall (from talk: “carefully defining a spec, generating the code, then reviewing it”):
      1. Plan (spec + blueprint) – deterministic scaffold.
      2. Build (code‑gen executes each prepared prompt sequentially).
      3. Review (tests + static analysis + human spot checks) → adjust → next loop.
    
    Feels iterative yet phases are intentionally *distinct* to reduce drift.
    
    Parallelism: spawn agents—feature implementation, documentation synthesis (implementation guide), test enhancement—driven off same plan → “concurrency on steroids”.
    
    Stress control: speed without losing architectural coherence or quality.
    
    Transition: This speed creates new risks. We need guardrails before we can safely operate at this velocity.
