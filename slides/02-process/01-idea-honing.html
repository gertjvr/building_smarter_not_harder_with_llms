        <li class="fragment">Describe idea; AI asks one question at a time</li>
        <li class="fragment">Outputs developer-ready specification</li>
        <li class="fragment">Requirements, architecture, data, errors, testing</li>
    </ul>

    Note:
    - Instead of jumping straight into code, you describe your idea to AI and let it ask one question at a time.
    - It builds on your answers, digs into every relevant detail, until you have a complete, developer-ready specification.
