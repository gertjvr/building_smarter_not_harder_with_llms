Shows progression from vague idea to structured specification. Style: hand-drawn to digital transformation, suggesting refinement through questioning. -->

    <h2>Idea Honing</h2>
        <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Describe idea; AI asks one question at a time</li>
        <li class="fragment">Outputs developer-ready specification</li>
        <li class="fragment">Requirements, architecture, data, errors, testing</li>
    </ul>

    Note:
    Idea Honing:
      - We resist the urge to code; we *interrogate* the idea.
      - Prompt: AI asks exactly one clarifying question at a time – forces depth, prevents premature assumptions.
      - Outcome: a developer‑ready spec covering requirements, architecture choices, data handling, error strategy, testing plan.
      - Benefit: shifts human effort to judgement & completeness instead of manual boilerplate.
      - Emphasize: This Q&A loop is fast but exhaustive; creates shared mental model before a single line is generated.
    
    Segue: Once spec is stabilized, we hand it to a reasoning model for blueprinting.
