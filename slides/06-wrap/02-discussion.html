    Note:
    Closing script:
      - “So: a rapid ‘new waterfall’—spec → blueprint → code → review—on hyperdrive.”
      - “Our creativity isn’t diminished; it’s redirected to choosing *what* and *why*, not just *how*.”
      - Tie back to opening contrast (vibe coding vs strategic orchestration).
      - Prompt discussion: What parts of this loop are you already doing? Where does it break in your org (culture, tooling, trust)?
      - Invite sharing of successes / horror stories (AI regressions caught—or missed—by guardrails).
      - Thank audience sincerely; encourage experimentation with small internal pilot using standards + blueprint approach.
    
    End: “Thank you.”
