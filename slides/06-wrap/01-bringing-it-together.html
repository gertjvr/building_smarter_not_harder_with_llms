    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: Three interconnected pillars or gears labeled "Plan", "AI", and "Guardrails" working together in harmony. Center shows controlled velocity/speed with quality maintained. Balance between speed and control emphasized. Style: engineering/architectural, suggesting stable foundation. -->
    
    ## Plan × AI × Guardrails

    - Fast code is useless without control. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Predictable, repeatable outcomes at scale <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    
    Note:
    Synthesis (talk conclusion themes):
      - Pillars: 
          - Detailed planning artifacts (spec + blueprint) 
          - Guardrails & defensive automation 
          - Enforceable standards
      - Core line: “Fast code is useless without control.”
      - Reframe AI: an “infinite junior engineer” executing well‑shaped intent; human value migrates to product resonance & strategic clarity.
      - Implication: differentiation shifts from elegance of handcrafted code to user impact & experience.
      - Encourage: treat each loop as a micro waterfall cycle—plan with precision, execute with leverage, review with rigor.
      - Set up final invite to discuss audience workflows & challenges adopting this.
