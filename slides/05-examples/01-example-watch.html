    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A smartwatch and companion mobile app interface mockup, with coding elements flowing between them (APIs, data sync). Time-lapse effect showing rapid development from idea to working prototype. Style: sleek product showcase with development workflow overlay. -->
    
    ## Example: Stress Watch App

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">AI handled boilerplate & integrations</li>
      <li class="fragment">Focus on concept & testing</li>
      <li class="fragment">Idea validation through rapid prototyping</li>
    </ul>

    Note:
    Framework validation through real implementation. This example shows the complete process + Strategic Engineer role + guardrails working together.
    
    Script: Watch app started with high-level idea; 15 min idea honing + spec + blueprint; AI generated project structure, dependencies, API scaffolding, integrations in hours instead of days. Strategic Engineer role: focused on product decisions, user flows, data validation, UI polish while AI handled boilerplate. Guardrails: mocks & stubs autoâ€‘generated for tests; static analysis caught issues; standards maintained velocity. Result: acceleration of boring parts, energy invested in high-value decisions.
