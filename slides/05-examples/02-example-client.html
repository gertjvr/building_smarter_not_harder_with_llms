    <!-- IMAGE PROMPT: A conference room scene with presentation screen showing working POC/demo, engaged client faces, developer at laptop orchestrating the live development process. Clock showing meeting timeframe. Style: professional meeting environment with live development energy. -->
    
    ## Example: Client POC

    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Requirements captured</li>
      <li class="fragment">Working POC by meeting end</li>
    </ul>
 
    Note:
    Live demonstration of rapid planning + Strategic Engineer orchestration in real-time meeting context.
    
    Script: Client POC showing idea honing in real-time during meeting; asked targeted questions live, fed answers through process, AI compiled spec and generated working POC before meeting ended. Strategic Engineer role: conducting the process, managing quality, projecting results. Result: meeting energy shifted from speculative to collaborative with immediate feedback loop. Shows framework working under pressure with stakeholders watching.
    
    Transition: These examples validate the complete framework - rapid planning + strategic orchestration + quality guardrails working together to build smarter, not harder.
