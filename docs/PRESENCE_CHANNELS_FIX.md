# Fixed: Client Events on Static Websites

## The Problem
You were getting: `"Client event rejected - only supported on private and presence channels"`

This happens because **Pusher's free tier doesn't support client events on public channels** - only on private and presence channels.

## The Solution âœ…
**Switched from public channels to presence channels**

### What Changed:
1. **Channel name:** `reveal-slides` â†’ `presence-reveal-slides`
2. **Added client-side authentication** for presence channels (no server needed)
3. **Updated all test tools** to use presence channels

### Files Updated:
- âœ… `pusher.config.js` - Changed to presence channel
- âœ… `assets/js/multiplex.js` - Added presence channel auth
- âœ… `test-pusher.html` - Updated for presence channels
- âœ… `docs/STATIC_WEBSITE_SETUP.md` - Updated instructions

## How Presence Channels Work (Static Website)

```javascript
// Simple client-side authentication (no server required)
authorizer: (channel, options) => {
  return {
    authorize: (socketId, callback) => {
      const authData = {
        auth: `${socketId}:${Date.now()}`, // Simple auth
        channel_data: JSON.stringify({
          id: 'user-' + Math.random(),
          name: isMaster ? 'Presenter' : 'Audience'
        })
      };
      callback(null, authData);
    }
  };
}
```

## Benefits of Presence Channels:
- âœ… **Client events work out of the box** (no dashboard settings needed)
- âœ… **See who's connected** (member join/leave events)
- âœ… **Free tier compatible**
- âœ… **No server required** (client-side auth)
- âœ… **Perfect for presentations**

## Test It Now:
1. **Local test:** `pnpm dev:master` and `pnpm dev:client` in separate tabs
2. **Cross-device:** Use your IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100:5173/?master=true`)
3. **Debug tool:** Open `test-pusher.html` in browser

## Status Indicators:
- ðŸŸ¢ "Presenter (Presence)" or "Audience (Presence)"
- Shows member count and join/leave events in console

**This should now work perfectly across different devices without any server! ðŸš€**
